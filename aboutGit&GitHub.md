## What is Git?
- Git is a *version control system*.
- It helps you *track changes* in our code or files.
- we can *go back* to earlier versions anytime.
- It allows *multiple people to work* on the same project.

## What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a *website* where we can store our Git projects online.
- It lets us *share code* with others.
- we can *collaborate* with teams or open-source communities.
- It shows our project history and helps with project management.
- Main features of GitHub:
  - *Repositories*: Where our code lives.
  - *Commits*: Saved versions of our work.
  - *Branches*: Try changes without breaking the main code.
  - *Pull Requests*: Ask to merge changes into main code.
